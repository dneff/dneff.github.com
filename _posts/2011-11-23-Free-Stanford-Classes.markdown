Interested in taking CS101 at Stanford? The university is offering that course (and 13 others) online for free. The list seems to have expanded recently, so this may be a partial listing. The footer of each class page has a complete listing.

Classes start in January 2012. There's a couple with supplimentary textbooks, but most are entirely free online materials. I'm limiting myself to two, not an easy task. Let's hope this trend continues.
