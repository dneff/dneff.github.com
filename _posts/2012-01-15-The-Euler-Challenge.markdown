title: The Euler Challenge

I'm late to the party, depending on your circle. I just discovered [Project Euler] [1] and took a stab at the first couple problems. Not bad!

There was some serendipty with the timing, as it's January and there were 366 problems at the time. Hmmm...

So my Euler Challenge is to complete 366 problems by 12/31/2012, using the following rules:

1. All problems must be solved using python
2. No custom libraries that cheap these to one-line exercises.
3. Ugly is ok, slow isn't-- find a sol'n in under 5 minutes.
4. Search for python tips/support, not for formulas-- at least until you have a solution.
5. Post all solutions to [github] [2] for feedback.

11 down, which means I'm only 4 days behind. Gotta catch'em all...
